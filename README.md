## âš™ Description âš™
 
Automation project in gradle for the Utest page, which is implemented with the Screenplay design pattern.
 
## ðŸ›  Packages ðŸ› 
 
The following describes what each package of the proposed base archetype should contain:
 
* **exceptions**: It contains the typology of the exceptions that you want to propagate in the execution of an automation.
* **interactions**: It contains the low-level activities that the actor requires to interact with the system.
* **models**: Contains the representation of real world objects with their characteristics.
* **questions**: It contains those classes that allow us to carry out validations about the state of the elements.
* **tasks**: It contains in each class a set of interactions that allow the actor to perform a complete action in the system.
* **userinterfaces**: Contains in each class the declaration of a user view, which in turn contains each element of the view.
* **utils**: It contains in each class logical transversal functions that allow to complete some of the processes.
* **runners**: It contains the classes that allow the features to be executed in a one-to-one relationship between the feature and the class.
* **stepdefinitions**: It contains the classes that implement the steps used in the features from which tasks (tasks) or questions (questions) can be invoked.
* **drivers**: It contains the files that are used to control browsers, applications, etc.
* **features**: Contains user stories in Gherkin language with declarative narrative in business terms.
* **data**: Contains files that can be data input to run some tests.
